This project is a web application for sentiment analysis that uses machine learning to classify user-submitted tweets or text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The backend is built with Flask and integrates a Logistic Regression model trained on user sentiment data, while the frontend includes a series of HTML pages that collect input and display classification results. The solution is designed for easy interaction, providing fast and clear sentiment feedback for social media or general text inputs.
